# Configure AWS CLI with Access Keys

**Step 1: Install AWS CLI**

Install AWS Command Line Interface from [Here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

`aws --version`
 

**Step 2: Configure AWS CLI with Access Keys**

To use AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key). If you donâ€™t have these keys, you can create them in the AWS Management Console.

1. Create Access Keys in AWS Console:
- Go to the IAM Console.
- In the left sidebar, click Users.
- Select the user you want to create access keys for.
- Go to the Security credentials tab.
- Under Access keys, click Create access key.
- Download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Save them securely, as the Secret Access Key will not be shown again.

Configure AWS CLI with Access Keys.\
`aws configure`

Enter the following details:
- AWS Access Key ID: Enter the Access Key ID from the previous step.
- AWS Secret Access Key: Enter the Secret Access Key from the previous step.
- Default region name: Enter the AWS region you want to use (e.g., us-west-2).
- Default output format: Enter the output format (e.g., json, text, or table).
  
**Step 3: Verify Configuration**

Verify the setup by running a simple AWS CLI command to check your configuration.

`aws s3 ls`
