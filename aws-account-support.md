Dear AWS Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance in transferring all certifications, benefits, and related records from my old AWS Certification account to my new account. I plan to discontinue using my old email address and continue my AWS certification journey with the new account.

Old Account Details:
Email: poisenasir@gmail.com
CertMetrics ID: AWS03398680
Pearson VUE ID: 299511852
Credly (Acclaim) Badging Email: poisenasir@gmail.com
VIBE ID: 004571d9-2767-4ab0-b738-fc0b4e8a409b

New Account Details:
Email: nasirnjs@gmail.com
CertMetrics ID: AWS04902576
Pearson VUE ID: 317086799
VIBE ID: 156a145b-b6a3-44e4-816d-e45f8f897229

I have successfully passed the following certifications under my old account:
AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)

I am planning to sit for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional exam soon and would like all my certifications, benefits, and associated records transferred to my new account to ensure continuity.

Please confirm once the transfer is complete and the old account is closed. Let me know if any additional information or documentation is required to facilitate this request.

Thank you for your support and assistance.
